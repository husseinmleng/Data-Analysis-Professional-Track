He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.

He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400\\xa0km (250\\xa0mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942.

As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India.

The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.<ref>From auto-biography Chapter 22, https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap22.htm</ref>\\n\\n====Vegetarianism and committee work====\\nGandhi\\'s time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London\\'s few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt\\'s]] writing, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society|London Vegetarian Society]] and was elected to its executive committee<ref name=\"Brown1991\">[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]].</ref> under the aegis of its president and benefactor [[Arnold Hills]]. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a [[Bayswater]] chapter.<ref name=\"Tendulkar1951\" /> Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the \\'\\'[[Bhagavad Gita]]\\'\\' both in translation as well as in the original.<ref name=\"Brown1991\"/>\\n\\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member [[Thomas Allinson]]. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\\n\\nAllinson had been promoting [[Birth control#Birth control movement|newly available birth control methods]], but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed [[History of vegetarianism#19th century|vegetarianism to be a moral movement]] and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills\\' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson\\'s right to differ.<ref name=shyness>{{cite web |title=Shyness my shield |url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm |work=Autobiography |date=1927 }}</ref> It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. He bankrolled the LVS and was a [[captain of industry]] with his [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] company employing more than 6,000 people in the [[East End of London]]. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club [[West Ham United]]. In his 1927 \\'\\'An Autobiography, Vol. I\\'\\', Gandhi wrote:\\n\\n{{blockquote| The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society<ref name=shyness/>}}\\n\\nA motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi\\'s shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi\\'s return to India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ivu.org/history/gandhi/1891-11.html|title=International Vegetarian Union – Mohandas K.

He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.\\n\\nGandhi joined the [[Indian National Congress]] and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale|Gokhale]]. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale\\'s liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.<ref name=\"Whiggism\"/>\\n\\nGandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi\\'s strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow [[Indigofera]], a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

A social boycott of \\'\\'mamlatdars\\'\\' and \\'\\'talatdars\\'\\' (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.<ref name=\"Brown1974\"/>\\n\\n====Khilafat movement====\\n\\n<blockquote>\\nEvery revolution begins with a single act of defiance.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with \\'\\'swaraj\\'\\' (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.<ref name=robbins133/> The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.<ref name=\"green89\"/> Gandhi announced his \\'\\'satyagraha\\'\\' (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the [[Rowlatt Act]], to block Gandhi\\'s movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\".<ref name=minault68/>\\n\\nGandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the [[Khilafat movement]], wherein [[Sunni]] Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish [[Caliph]] as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (\\'\\'[[ummah]]\\'\\'). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I.<ref>Minault, Gail (1982) \\'\\'The Khilafat Movement Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India\\'\\', [[Columbia University Press]], {{ISBN|0-231-05072-0}}, pp. 4–8</ref><ref name=paine20/><ref name=ghosep161/> Gandhi\\'s support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results.

F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all [[political prisoner]]s, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India\\'s independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin\\'s successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.<ref name=\"Herman2008\">[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA375 pp. 375–77.]</ref>\\n\\nIn Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans.

Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the Buddha to be a Hindu.<ref name=\"Jordens1998p107\"/> He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly influenced him.

Prominent Muslim allies in his nonviolent resistance movement included [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan]].

He was critical of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity.<ref name=\"Bauman2015p56\"/> According to Gandhi, this was not true \"service\" but one driven by an ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of \"love\", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and other religions, and divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion.

He justified this support by invoking Islam, stating that \"non-Muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction\" in \\'\\'Jazirat al-Arab\\'\\' (the Arabian Peninsula).<ref name=\"Kumaraswamy2010p36\"/> These arguments, states Kumaraswamy, were a part of his political strategy to win Muslim support during the [[Khilafat Movement#Khilafat Movement in South Asia|Khilafat movement]]. In the post-Khilafat period, Gandhi neither negated Jewish demands nor did he use Islamic texts or history to support Muslim claims against Israel. Gandhi\\'s silence after the Khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over Palestine, according to Kumaraswamy.<ref name=\"Kumaraswamy2010p36\"/> In 1938, Gandhi spoke in favour of Jewish claims, and in March 1946, he said to the Member of British Parliament [[Sidney Silverman]], \"if the Arabs have a claim to Palestine, the Jews have a prior claim\", a position very different from his earlier stance.<ref name=\"Kumaraswamy2010p36\">{{cite book|author=P.

Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi\\'s strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow [[Indigofera]], a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

The British Government agreed to free all [[political prisoner]]s, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India\\'s independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin\\'s successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement.
